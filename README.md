# hex-dots

A game based on [Dots](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2X1s4aMSUrE) but with a hexagonal twist. Built using [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/phaser3), and bundled using [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/).

## Gameplay

* Click and drag from a dot start a line.
* Chain adjacent dots of similar color to clear them from the board.
* Creating a loop of dots will clear all dots of that color.
* Creating a circle around a single dot will clear the entire board.
* How high of a score can you get within the time limit?
